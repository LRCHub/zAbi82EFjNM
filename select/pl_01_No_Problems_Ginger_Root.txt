Go get what you want
Get hip to the signs and
then you
Get lost in your thoughts
Just trying to prove,
what's with you now?
And again
Times I've tried to bow
and amend
The far and the fake, look
the sunlight's fadin'
How can you say this is not
for debatin'?
Ah, how can you say that
you've got no problems?
I, I can't be fake, when
you're up and elated
How, how can I say that
you've got no problems too?
Now, tell me what's wrong
There's something behind
your grinning
Been waiting too long
The show startin' soon,
head's spinning 'round
Not again
Times I've tried to bow
and amend
The far and the fake, look
the sunlight's fadin'
How can you say this is not
for debatin'?
Ah, how can you say that
you've got no problems?
I, I can't be fake, when
you're up and elated
How, how can I say that
you've got no problems?
I, I can't take this, it's
not debated
Ah, how can you say that
you've got no problems?
I, I can't be fake, when
you're up and elated
How, how can I say that
you've got no problems?
That you've got no problems
That you've got no problems
How can you say this is not
for debatin'?
Ah, how can you say that
you've got no problems?
I can't be fake, when you're
up and elated
How, how can I say that I've
got no problems too?
That I've got no problems too
That I've got no problems too
